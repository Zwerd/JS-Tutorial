/*
Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
*/

/*
Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts.

Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).

Statement 3 is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed.

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += 'The number is ' + i + '<br>'
  console.log(text)
