//Why Strict Mode?
//Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

//Not Allowed in Strict Mode
"use strict";
var x;
x = 3.14 // This will cause an error

//this is object
"use strict";
var z;
z = {p1:10, p2:20};      // This will cause an error

//delete the variable
"use strict";
var x = 3.14;
delete x;                // This will cause an error

//canot use string like build in element in JavaScript
"use strict";
var eval = 3.14;         // This will cause an error


/*
Watch Out!
The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
